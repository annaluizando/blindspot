# 🔦 blindspot - a code security game!

A terminal interactive game designed to train yourself to identify insecure coding practices based on the OWASP Top 10, in a practical and fun way!

Feel free to play, analyze, modify, and contribute. New ideas and collaborations are always welcome :)

## 🪜 Get Started!

Here is step-by-step what you need to run this project:

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/annaluizando/blindspot.git
cd blindspot
make build
make install
```

### Playing

Now, to play blindspot, you can simply run by it's name:

```
blindspot
```

If you want to open blindspot directly in a random challenge, filtering by difficulty, you can run using flags.

#### Flags:

--difficulty
where difficulty levels are:
0 = Beginner,
1 = Intermediate,
2 = Advanced

Example, playing random intermediate challenges:

```
blindspot --difficulty=1
```

--category
where categories are categories in challenges.yaml, you can see all categories by using:

```
blindspot --help
```

Then, when you know which category you want, pass it's exact string to flag
Example, playing only injection challenges:

```
blindspot --category="Injection"
```

## ✨ Features

The following features can be accessed in the "Settings" section, which allows you to customize your learning experience:

### 🔍 Vulnerability Name Display Toggle

It's possible to change visibility of vulnerability names to adjust if those names should appear or not in the top of challenges.
Hiding names creates a more challenging experience where you must identify vulnerabilities completely on your own.

### 🔄 Challenge Order

Two playing modes are available:

- **Random by Difficulty** - A more "advanced" way of playing, where vulnerabilities appear grouped by difficulty level, progressing from beginner to advanced. If you want the "hardest" way of playing, combine this with Vulnerability names: Hide.
- **Category Order** - A more directed way to train your eye for specific vulnerability category, as vulnerabilities appear grouped by their category.

## 📝 Progress Tracking

Track your learning journey through each vulnerability category wit completion percentages for each category that can be seen in "Categories" and/or "Progress".

## ⌨️ Controls

- Use arrow keys to navigate
- Press `Enter` to select
- Press `n` or `Enter` to go to next challenge
- Press `q` to quit at any time

## FAQ

### Q: I want to erase my progress and saved settings, how can I do this?

A: You can accomplish this by running the game > selecting "Settings" > clicking "Delete all progress data"

### Q: I want to write my own challenges, how can I do this?

A: You can accomplish this by changing your assets/challenges.yaml and filling information according
your questions. Each question needs to be in the following format:

```yaml
- category: string, all categories must have equal string to be in same category,
  description: string,
  challenges:

  - id: string,
    title: string, name of vulnerability,
    description: string, with brief description about problem,
    difficulty: 0 for Beginner, 1 for Intermediate and 2 for Advanced,
    code: |

    - your code pasted here -

    options:

    - "Option A"
    - "Option B"
    - "Option C"
      correctAnswer: string, equal to one of options,
      hint: string,
      lang: string, preferebly one of [supported languages in chroma lib](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-languages) for code highlighthing
```
